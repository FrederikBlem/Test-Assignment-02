## 1 Reflections

### 1.1 Computer Mouse
Identify the types of testing you would perform on a computer mouse, to make sure 
that it is of the highest quality.

Identify factors/criteria used to determine "highest quality" and test them. For example:
* __Hand support.__ <br>__End user tests__ at different lengths of time.
* __Part longevity.__ <br>The equivalent of __unit tests__.
* __Response time.__ <br>__Both unit test equivalents and integration tests__.
* __Number of buttons__ (and programmability?). <br>__Both unit test equivalents and integration tests__.
* __Customizability.__ <br>__Both unit test equivalents and integration tests__ (because a customizable width or LED lights sometimes need to work with software for example.)

### 1.2 Catastrophic Failure
Find a story where a software system defect had a bad outcome. Describe what 
happened. Can you identify a test that would have prevented it?

* @BeforeAll, @AfterAll 
* @DisplayName 
* @Nested 
* assumeFalse, assumeTrue

### 3.2 Mocking Frameworks
Investigate mocking frameworks for your preferred language. Choose at least two 
frameworks, and answer the questions. (One could be Mockito, which we saw in class.)

#### Mocking Framework 1

#### Mocking Framework 2
